# AI Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that I've been working on. The projects showcase different AI techniques and applications, ranging from machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of practical AI implementations, demonstrating key concepts and helping to foster learning and experimentation with AI.

## Projects

### 1. **AI-Powered Chatbot for Academic Assistance**
This project aims to build an AI-driven chatbot that helps manage academic content, including course schedules, deadlines, and learning materials. The bot provides real-time responses based on the stored data, helping students stay organized and focused. This project leverages AI techniques such as natural language understanding and dialogue management.

### 2. **Slime Castle Stats - AI Integration**
A web-based project designed to track and optimize game statistics for the game *Slime Castle*. The website allows users to interact with game data, displaying statistics about slimes, their attributes, and gameplay performance. Future plans involve integrating AI to provide intelligent recommendations based on historical data and user input.

### 3. **PaperGO - AI for Delivery System Optimization**
*PaperGO* is a delivery system that connects travelers with people who need urgent document delivery. The system uses AI to optimize delivery routes, predict optimal delivery times, and manage logistics. It includes both frontend and backend components, with AI algorithms implemented to improve the system's efficiency.

### 4. **AI for Resume and Profile Enhancement**
In this project, AI is applied to improve the presentation of personal profiles, including resumes and LinkedIn profiles. The goal is to provide actionable feedback for optimizing content, helping users create professional and appealing online profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For AI algorithms and backend logic.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For machine learning models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used in chatbots and profile enhancement projects.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated for enhanced AI capabilities, such as language generation and classification.
